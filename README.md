# dart-data-structures-challenges

We are looking for trainees who can learn independently and take on challenges. To showcase this skill, we request that you read specific sections from a book offered by [Kodeco](https://www.kodeco.com/). Your task involves a detailed exploration of the following topics with solving some challenges:

* Basic Data Structures in Dart.
* Stacks.
* Linked List.

The challenges are as follows:

**1. Stacks:**

* **Challenge 1: Reverse a List**
    Create a function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order.
* **Challenge 2: Balance the Parentheses**
    Check for balanced parentheses. Given a string, check if there are `(` and `)` characters, and return true if the parentheses in the string are balanced.

**1. Linked List:**

* **Challenge 1: Print in Reverse**
    Create a function that prints the nodes of a linked list in reverse order.
* **Challenge 2: Find the Middle Node**
    Create a function that finds the middle node of a linked list.
* **Challenge 3: Reverse a Linked List**
    Create a function that reverses a linked list. You do this by manipulating the nodes so that they're linked in the other direction.
* **Challenge 4: Remove All Occurrences**
  
    Create a function that removes all occurrences of a specific element from a linked list. The implementation is similar to the `removeAfter` method that you implemented earlier.

Thoroughly understand these topics and submit a repository containing your solutions for the six challenges related to stacks and linked lists.
